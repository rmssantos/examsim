## 🎯 Two Usage Modes

### Mode 0: Portable Bundle (No Install Required)

| Best for | People who just want to unzip and double-click |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|

1. Download the latest release ZIP (or clone the repo) and keep the `portable/` folder intact.
2. Extract it anywhere—USB drive, Desktop, cloud folder—no admin rights needed.
3. Double-click `index.html` to use the homepage, `exam.html` to jump straight into an exam, or `editor.html` to build content.
4. Import exams by dragging `dump.json`/`.zip` files onto the homepage or copying folders into `user-content/exams/`.

> Want richer metadata or guaranteed image paths later? Just open a terminal in the same folder and run `python server.py`. You can hop between zero-install and server mode anytime.

### Mode 1: With Server (Recommended)

**Best for:** Full features, automatic exam detection, image support

```bash
python server.py
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Auto-detects exams in `user-content/exams/`
- ✅ Beautiful exam cards with full metadata
- ✅ Images load perfectly
- ✅ Drag & drop imports work
- ✅ All features enabled
- ✅ Dark mode works everywhere
- ✅ Progress tracking across all exams

---

### Mode 2: Direct File (Simple)

**Best for:** Quick access, no installation needed

1. Double-click `index.html`
2. Drag `dump.json` files to import exams
3. Start practicing

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Must import exams manually (drag & drop)
- ⚠️ Images may not load properly
- ⚠️ Generic exam cards

---

## 📋 What's Included

### Pages

| File | Purpose | URL |
|------|---------|-----|
| `index.html` | Homepage (exam selection, progress dashboard) | `/` |
| `exam.html` | Exam simulator | `/exam.html?exam=<examId>` |
| `editor.html` | Question editor | `/editor.html` |

### Example Usage

```bash
# Direct exam access (replace <examId> with your exam code)
http://localhost:8000/exam.html?exam=myexam
http://localhost:8000/exam.html?exam=certification

# Editor
http://localhost:8000/editor.html
```

## 📦 Importing Exams

### Automatic (Server Mode)

Place exam folders in `user-content/exams/`:

```
user-content/exams/
├── example-exam/
│   ├── dump.json         ← Questions
│   ├── metadata.json     ← Exam info (optional)
│   └── images/           ← Images (optional)
└── my-exam/
    └── (same structure)
```

Refresh the page → Exams appear automatically!

---

### Manual (Drag & Drop)

1. Open simulator in browser
2. Drag `dump.json` file onto the homepage
3. Exam imported to browser storage
4. Card appears immediately

Dropping a `.zip` exam pack works too—the simulator reads `dump.json`/`metadata.json` automatically and lets you know if you need to copy bundled images into `user-content/exams/<examId>/images/`.

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "No exams found"
- **Fix:** Add exams to `user-content/exams/` folder
- **Or:** Import via drag & drop

### Images not loading
- **Fix:** Use server mode (`python server.py`)
- **Not:** `file://` protocol (double-click)

### Dark mode not working
- **Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **Clear cache** if issue persists
- **Verify:** `.dark-mode` class should be on `<body>` element

### Progress cards show no data
- **Fix:** Complete at least one exam to generate progress
- **Note:** Data is stored per-exam in local browser storage

### Exam shows "DUMP" name
- **Fix:** Add `metadata.json` to exam folder
- **Or:** Accept generic name for testing

### Save not working in editor
- **Fix:** Check browser site data/storage is enabled
- **Backup:** Export questions as JSON regularly

### Giant empty space in exam view
- **Fixed:** This was a CSS issue with `min-height` - should be resolved in v2.0

## 📊 Data Storage

Everything is stored locally in browser storage:

```javascript
// Questions, metadata, and detailed progress
IndexedDB['ExamContentDB'].exams
IndexedDB['ExamContentDB'].progress

// Images
IndexedDB['ExamImagesDB'].images
IndexedDB['ExamImagesDB'].image_metadata

// Legacy compatibility mirrors may exist
localStorage['custom_<examId>_questions']
localStorage['exam_metadata_<examId>']
localStorage['<examId>_progress']

// Settings
localStorage['exam_activation_config']

// Theme preference
localStorage['theme']
```

**Clear data:** Browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear

**Backup data:** Use "Export Progress" and export questions from editor
